# Cookies and Sessions Practice - Starter Code

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It was also built using Ruby v2.7.4 on Rails v7.0.4*

## Overview
This is the starter code file for my blog post on getting started with cookies and sessions.

[Follow along with my blog post on cookies/sessions]() to build out the rest of the Rails back end.

This gif provides a basic walkthrough of what the finished product should look like for the login/sign up page.
